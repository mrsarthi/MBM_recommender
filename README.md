## Latest Release notes:

This version introduces **app memory** to create a smarter, more personal experience:

* **Remembers Your File:** The app now saves your `watched.csv` file path. You only need to select it once on the first launch.
* **"Mark as Seen" Button:** You can now click a movie in the results and mark it as "seen." The app will add this to its own memory file (`app_memory.csv`).
* **Smarter Filtering:** The app now checks *both* your original `watched.csv` and its new `app_memory.csv` to ensure you never get recommended a movie you've already seen or marked.
* **"View Details" Button:** You can now select a movie from the results and click this button to open its official TMDB page in your browser.
